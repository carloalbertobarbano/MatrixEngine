# MatrixEngine
A very basic OpenGL egine implementing a Scene Graph


#Collaboration
Feel free to collaborate with this project, adding features, fixing bugs..
Currently there is a runtime bug/issue with the glm library, making it crashes when it starts rendering the scene. 
I had no time to figure out what it was, though. 

#Requirements
In order to work it requires the glm library: http://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.7/index.html
and the assimp library: http://assimp.sourceforge.net/
