# MatrixEngine
A very basic OpenGL egine implementing a Scene Graph


#Collaboration
Feel free to collaborate with this project, adding features, fixing bugs..
Currently there is a runtime bug with the glm library, making it crash when it starts rendering the scene. 
I had no time to figure out what it was, though. 

#Requirements
In order to work it requires the glm library: http://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.7/index.html
the assimp library: http://assimp.sourceforge.net/ and SDL 1.2 https://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php with SDL_Image library

The engine is also based on SDL 1.2 libs, so feel also free to implement compatibility with SDL 2.x libs.
OpenGL 3.3 or higher required.
